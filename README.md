self introduction

Hello, everyone!:-)

I am Yingan Chen and I came from Shanghai China. 
I'm the first year student in MHS program in Bloomberg school of public health and major in Epidemiology.
This is my first time to be in US. I experienced a lot of fresh things here these weeks. I love professors, classmates and every nice persons I met in Baltimore city. I also tried Crab cake which is really famous in Baltimore and I very like it. Baltimore is really an enthusiastic city and I believe I will enjoy the time spend here.
